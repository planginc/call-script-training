There are multiple factors that I see impacting clients on their credit reports. The main one is high credit utilization, which decreases your credit score and increases your interest rates. This makes it almost impossible for you to pay off the debts in a reasonable amount of time, even though you\'re making your payments on time every month. Does this sound similar to your situation with your accounts?\n\n**Prospect:** yes, it does.\n\n**Agent:** ok, let\'s take a closer look at your report and see how we can assist!'
