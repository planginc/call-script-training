# Eligible Debts
- Major credit cards, department store and furniture cards, unsecured personal loans including payday, private student loans, prior bank loans, installment loans open at least 30 days, finance companies, **leases that are charged off**, business debt not on personal credit, gas cards, **repo deficiency balances**, cell phone bills not with current provider, many credit unions except state employee CUs, jewelry store cards, **medical at any delinquency**, cash advances and balance transfers with **one full payment made**, back rent if no longer living there, ITIN accepted, unmarried co-applicants allowed if it makes sense.【24†source】

## Unacceptable Creditors and Debts
- Anything on wheels still owned, federal or state student loans, loans secured by house or land, current utilities, NSF checks, military loans, rent-to-own unless charged off, warranty unless in collections, insurance policies unless tied to totaled car deficiency, cash checking, attorney fees (see PDF for caveats), bank fees, **timeshares**. Special list of ~12 to 15 creditors we cannot take; if not on list, usually acceptable with caveats.【24†source】

## Chase/Amex Accounts
- Acceptable. We can enroll 100 percent medical, AMEX, or Discover. We can also leave accounts off if client insists after you explain risks.【23†source】

## Capital One Accounts
(Use PDF creditor-specific guidance if present.)

## Set-Off Rights
(From PDF.)

## Cross-Collateralization
(From PDF.)

## Debt Left Off
- It is the client's program. Educate on downsides of keeping one card for emergencies and document the decision.【23†source】

## Terms
- Minimum **$10,000** total enrolled debt to qualify.  
- **$450** minimum balance per account.  
- **$200** minimum monthly draft not including optional legal protection.  
- Typical fee models vary by amount; see company rate card. (Your note references 27 percent and 29 percent attorney model variations.)

## Key Takeaways
- If an item is not on the unacceptable list, it is likely workable with documentation or a caveat. Use creditor intelligence and underwriting when unsure.【24†source】

## Compliance Notes
> Preserve exact unacceptable creditor list from the PDF in production. Do not paraphrase names.
