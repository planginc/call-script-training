# AE Role & Expectations
- First point of contact. Focus the first ~5 minutes on understanding the client's situation and goals without using the word **hardship** if it may offend.【23†source】
- Do not pull credit until ~10 minutes in, after rapport and buying signals.【23†source】
- Qualify, consult, set expectations, and ensure affordability. Avoid sugarcoating.【23†source】

## Department Goals
- **Speed to Payment**: aim for **14 days or less** to first draft; min 3 non-holiday days, max 30 days without manager note.【23†source】
- Prefer **split drafts** aligned to pay dates. Splits help budgeting and commission eligibility once ~45% of first payment clears.【23†source】
- **Productive rate** target ~75% in available status. **Wrap-up** under ~5%. **First draft rate** 60%+ for commission. **Legal protection** attach rate ~90%+. **Close per day** goal near 1 as you ramp.【23†source】

## Client Relationships
- Be honest, return calls, keep appointments, set correct expectations. Most cancels are due to broken expectations or unaffordable payments.【23†source】

## Key Takeaways
- Pipeline balance: same day closes vs follow ups. Not every client should close same day.【23†source】

## Compliance Notes
> Never instruct clients to change contact info to dodge creditors. We do not do that. Educate and prepare them for calls instead.【23†source】

## Examples
**Text before first draft**
"Just checking in. Your first split draft is set for Friday which matches your pay date. Reply if anything changed."【23†source】
