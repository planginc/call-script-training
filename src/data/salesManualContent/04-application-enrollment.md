Revised 9.202 5 Application and Enrollment Process 
 
Once a lead has expressed interest in debt settlement, the account executive 
creates a free savings analysis or pre -application ( pre-app) for them. This 
involves pulling the lead’s credit. The AE enters their creditors, balances, and 
delinquencies into our database and our Customer Relationship Management 
(CRM ) tool formulates a program summary to determine the cost of their debt 
settlement program . Once the AE knows how long the lead can be on the 
program, they can enter it into the database to find the mo nthly program draft. 
 
The account executive completes a budget with the lead to ensure they are a 
good fit for a debt settlement program and then submits the file for pre -
approval. If the file is pre -approved and the budget shows they can afford the 
program, the AE will get banking information and verify the client’s identity . 
This will generate the agreement to send to the client to sign. 
 
After the agreement is signed, the AE submits the file for final approval. 
AE pulls credit and 
identifies eligible debts. AE designs program 
(payment/terms/date).AE complets budget with 
lead and submits for 
preapproval.AE goes over agreement 
and client signs it. 
Submits for final 
approval.
