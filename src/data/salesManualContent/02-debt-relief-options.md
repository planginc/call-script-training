# Debt Settlement 101
- Negotiation to resolve unsecured debt for less than owed, typical term 24 to 48 months. Average term 48 months.【23†source】
- Historical settlement range roughly **40% to 60% off** each account before fees.【23†source】
- First settlement usually within **60 to 120 days**; collections accounts can settle sooner, sometimes ~30 days. Set expectation with 60 to 120 days.【23†source】

## Comparison of All Options
Use a consultative approach. Clients often fall into 3 buckets:
1) Already behind 30 days or more
2) Anticipate falling behind
3) Current but treading water
About **70%** call in fully current.【23†source】

### Why status matters early
- If already behind, budget risk is higher. They have fewer objections about credit score since damage started.【23†source】
- If current, expect more questions about closing cards and score impact. You **must** use the phrase **voluntarily discontinue payments** when explaining next steps.【23†source】

## Credit Counseling / DMP
- Repay **100%** of debt with reduced interest over ~5 years. One consolidated payment. Collection calls stop after enrollment.【23†source】
- Suits debt under **$10k** or when credit damage is unacceptable. Advanced delinquency generally disqualifies since interest is gone.【23†source】

## Bankruptcy
- Ch. 7 on report up to **10 years**, public record up to **20**. Upfront attorney fees. Ch. 13 is 3 to 5 years with trustee plan.【23†source】
- Often a last resort. Use as a comparison point when client is close but not there yet.【23†source】

## DIY (Snowball/Avalanche)
- Requires 2.5x to 3x minimums to touch principal. High discipline needed. Many clients tried this for years without success.【23†source】

### DIY Settlements
- Individuals lack leverage and are usually asked for **lump sum or 3 installments**, which is hard to save. Our term settlements typically run **12 to 24 payments** due to track record and volume leverage.【23†source】

## Consolidation Loan
- One loan to pay cards. Often secured by collateral. Initial score boost may taper. **80%** of people re-accumulate debt within two years if behavior does not change.【23†source】
- Rates are high right now; prime approvals are harder.【23†source】

## Debt Settlement (Our Program)
- Monthly draft into **client-owned** settlement account managed by Global Holdings. We settle debts one by one. We collect fee only after creditor is paid on that account.【23†source】
- Pros: cheapest resolution, shorter than most alternatives, payment usually half to two thirds of current required minimums.【23†source】
- Cons: creditor calls during delinquency, credit score declines, low but possible litigation risk, potential tax implications.【23†source】

(Insert from PDF.)

## Key Takeaways
- Present all five options neutrally to avoid UDAAP issues.【23†source】
- Use **healthy** framing instead of absolute statements.【23†source】

## Compliance Notes
> Use the exact phrase: **"voluntarily discontinue payments"** when instructing current clients on stopping payments.【23†source】

## Examples
**Timeline example**
"Based on your mix, we expect your first settlement in about 60 to 120 days. Collections accounts can come sooner."【23†source】

Revised 9.202 5 Debt Settlement 101 
 
Debt settlement , also known as debt negotiation or credit settlement , is an approach to unsecured debt 
reduction in which the debtor and creditor agree on a settlement of the debt for less than the full outstanding 
amount due that will satisfy the debt obligation . As a debt settlement firm, we advocate for those who are 
experiencing financial hardship . We are often able to settle our clients’ debts for significantly less th an what 
they owe and offer them a program payment that is far less than their required minimum monthly payments 
to credit card companies . We also advocate for our clients by not char ging any fees until a settlement has 
been reached . This means clients do not pay us a dime in fees until they have seen the results . Our average 
clients fall into one of the three following categories: 
 
1. They have already fallen behind on their payments. 
2. They anticipate falling behind on their payments in the future; or 
3. They are only able to make their minimum monthly payments , are unable to pay their balances down , 
and are willing to utilize a serious debt relief option to resolve their debt. 
 
Concept 
 
Most of our clients are unable to maintain their payments to their creditors prior to contacting us. Those who 
are current would need to voluntarily discontinue their payments. COA cannot mandate they breach 
agreements with the creditors, and we cannot instruct a client to cease making payments to their creditors; it 
must be a conscious decision made by the client. By falling behind or withholding payments from the 
creditors, COA will then have the leverage to reach settlements for less than the original b alances. When a 
creditor is receiving minimum monthly payments from their customers there is absolutely no incentive for 
them to settle the consumer’s debt. When the creditor sees that the client is in financial hardship (by non -
payment) they would often rather collect a portion of what is owed rather than nothing at all. 
 
After 180 days of delinquency the primary 
creditor will often charge off the debt 
(essentially, an accounting action that lists 
the debt as bad debt) . In many instances, 
they assign the debt for collections with a 3rd 
party debt collector or sell the debt to a 
debt buyer for pennies on the dollar. Big 
banks will do this to get the delinquent debt 
off their books and to cut their losses. 
Because the debt buyer paid far less for the 
debt than what was originally owed, th ey 
are often willing to take a lesser amount to 
resolve the debt. Once the settlement has 
been agreed upon and a se ttlement 
payment made, the creditor recoups a 
portion of the outstanding balance, COA is able to collect our fees, and the client is able to resolve their debt . 
This is why debt settlement has become one of the most popular ways to resolve unsecured debt for those in 
financial hardship .

Bankruptcy 
 
Consumers who believe they have no other alternative often decide to file bankruptcy. Many consumers file 
for Chapter 7, which eliminates their debts entirely. If they don’t qualify for Chapter 7 they can file Chapter 13, 
in which a court determines the percentage o f the debt that is to be paid to the creditors over a set period. 
 Chapter 7 Chapter 13 
Stays on credit 10 years 7 years 
How much debt paid back nothing A percentage 
Protects assets? no yes 
Qualifications Strict, difficult to qualify for Less strict 
Monthly payment no To trustee 
Time to complete 1-3 months 3-5 years 
 
Advantages Disadvantages 
▪ Protects certain types of assets (home equity, 
retirement fund, etc.) depending on state 
laws. 
▪ With Chapter 7, a consumer can become 
debt -free and start over. 
▪ For people who are so deep in financial 
hardship that they can’t afford to make the 
payments necessary for debt settlement, 
bankruptcy is often the best option. ▪ Traumatic damage to a consumer’s credit 
▪ Chapter 13 stays on your credit report for 7 
years and Chapter 7 stays on for 10 years. 
▪ Can affect certain types of employment and 
the ability to obtain some professional 
licenses. 
▪ Process is generally an unpleasant 
experience. 
▪ 2005 law made it difficult to qualify for 
Chapter 7.

With this option, the consumer significantly increases their monthly credit card payments, one account at a 
time until each is paid in full. Some pay the accounts with the highest interest rate first while others pay the 
accounts with the smallest balance first. As one card is being paid off more quickly, minimum payments are 
made on the other cards. 
Advantages Disadvantages 
▪ The consumer is in full control. 
▪ There is no damage to a consumer’s credit; 
this will improve their credit. ▪ Requires the consumer to be extremely 
disciplined. 
▪ Consumers must be able to establish an 
emergency fund, tighten their budgets, and 
stop using credit. 
 
 
Consolidation Loan 
 
Consumers can pay off their debts in full by obtaining a loan combining all the credit card debt into one lower 
monthly payment. Homeowners with significant equity can refinance their mortgage and use the proceeds to 
pay off their debt. Consumers with exce llent credit can do a balance transfer to a low interest or no interest 
introductory rate card. 
Advantages Disadvantages 
▪ Easy to manage one lower monthly payment 
instead of multiple payments 
▪ The loan interest rate is lower than the rates 
on their cards. 
▪ No effect to credit 
 ▪ Debt is usually secured by collateral, which 
puts the secured asset at risk if the consumer 
defaults. 
▪ Within 2 years after consolidating, many 
people have reloaded their credit card debt 
back to original levels. 
▪ Interest rates are fairly high right now, not 
making payments decline by much and are 
harder to get approved for

Revised 9.202 5 Debt Settlement 
 
This involves negotiation on a consumer’s behalf with their creditors to settle their outstanding 
debt for less than what’s owed and within 2 -4 years. COA’s historical average settlement has 
been approximately 40% -60% of each settled account’s balance. Clients make monthly 
payments to a settlement account that is owned and controlled by the client and maintained by 
a third -party payment processor (Global Holdings ). As funds accumulate in the settlement 
account, we work to settle the creditor accounts one by one in either a lump sum settlement or 
a multi -installment (term) settlement. 
Advantages Disadvantages 
▪ On average, we save our completed 
clients around 30%, even including 
our fees. 
▪ Debt settlement is designed to be a 
shorter program than debt 
consolidation, credit counseling, or 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy. 
▪ The average monthly program 
payment is often around ½ -2/3 of 
what the consumer pays to their 
creditors. 
▪ One of the cheapest debt resolution 
options ▪ Clients are subjected to creditor calls 
and collection attempts as accounts 
go delinquent. We can’t stop 
collection efforts. 
▪ Credit is negatively impacted as 
accounts go delinquent. For many 
clients, this isn’t a concern because 
their credit was poor upon entering 
the program. Also, clients should not 
be focused on their credit score, 
which will only allow them to incur 
more debt. 
▪ Creditors can pursue litigation.

Revised 9.202 5 Account Executive (AE) Role & Expectations 
 
The COA account executive plays a critical role in our success. The AE is the first contact 
with clients and therefore need s to be a strong communicator and have a passion for helping 
those in financial hardship. 
 
Our AEs provide consultation to clients who are dealing with a wide range of financial 
problems. These issues can include, but are not limited to the following : 
• Divorce 
• Reduction/ loss in income 
• Medical issues 
• Increase in interest rates 
• Seasonal income 
• Death of a spouse 
A big part of the AEs job is to find out what happened to the client financially to get them 
into their situation ( their financial hardship) and what the best plan of action is to relieve 
them of their overwhelming debt burden. For this reason , it is very important for our AEs to 
be educated on the various options our clients have in regard to resolving their debts. A 
consultative approach will allow the AE to provide the client with information regarding their 
debt relief options rather than selling them o n a one - size-fits-all product. A large portion of 
an AEs responsibilities lies in qualifying (or disqualifying) a client for a debt settlement 
program through verifying the ir debt amount, analyzing affordability , and evaluating their 
overall eligibility for debt settlement. Debt settlement may not be the best fit for some and 
it’s up to the client, AE, and our underwriting team to determine whether debt settlement is 
a viable optio n. Considering our relationships with our clients last anywhere between 2 to 4 
years, making su re the clients we enroll are completely informed of the process and properly 
qualified is of the utmost importance. An AEs specific responsibilities include: 
• Qualifying clients by assessing their financial situation 
• Providing consultation to the client regarding their options , and the advantages and 
disadvantages of each 
• Helping clients plan and manage their budgets 
• Helping clients set short –term and long -term financial goals 
• Following underwriting guidelines and sending pre -applications to underwriting for 
approval 
• Explaining in great detail how a settlement program works so that each c lient has 
proper expectations as to what to expect during their settlement program 
• Educating clients on enrollment forms and thorou ghly answering any questions or 
concerns they have about those documents
