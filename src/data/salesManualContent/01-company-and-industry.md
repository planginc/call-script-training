Revised 9.202 5 History of the Debt Settlement Industry 
 
Debt settlement, as an industry, came about mostly after the enactment of the Bankruptcy 
Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act ( BAPCPA ) in 2005, which made filing for 
bankruptcy much more difficult . Essentially, consumers that needed debt relief assistance 
couldn’t qualify for bankruptcy and couldn’t afford a debt management plan offered by a credit 
counseling agency had nowhere to turn . Hence, the birth of mainstream debt settlement. 
 
Debt settlement service providers work on behalf of overextended consumers to negotiate a 
materially reduced resolution with each of their creditors . The consumer agrees to make 
periodic payments into a type of savings account. Cash accumulates in this account, and the 
debt resolution provider uses this cash to negotiate settlements with creditors . Service 
providers in this industry earn a fee for service when they successfully negotiate a resolution on 
behalf of one of their consumer clients. 
 
In the early years, there were very low barriers to entry and anyone with a computer, phone 
and a little cash could set up a debt settlement company . In addition, companies were allowed 
to charge their entire fee up -front to the consumers . That led to many un ethical actors entering 
the industry and essentially just taking consumers’ money without performing the actual debt 
settlement work. 
 
In July 2010, the FTC issued a final amendment to the Telemarketing Sales Rule (the “Final 
Rule”), which regulates telemarketers of for -profit debt relief services, including credit 
counseling, debt settlement and debt negotiation services. Basically, the FTC Rule put a stop to 
the charging of “advance fees” and, in effect, caused about 80% of the industry to go out of 
business. It also helped weed out many of the bad actors. 
 
Since taking effect on September 27, 2010, the Final Rule has helped to legitimize and advance 
the industry by creating a new playing field that favors stronger, better capitalized companies 
that deliver a true value -added service to their customers . With an unblemished track record 
and a sophisticated set of proprietary analytics, ClearOne can capture market share and 
become one of the key leaders in this industry.

Revised 9.202 5 The Debt Settlement Industry 
 
The Debt Settlement Industry, although new compared to credit counseling, is maturing and 
establishing itself into the mainstream. A select few national companies, including ClearOne 
Advantage, have emerged to offer debt settlement services. Through the na tional industry 
association, the Consumer Debt Relief Initiative (CDRI ), the industry is adopting increased self -
monitoring of member debt settlement companies and members must follow a strict code of ethics 
when providing services to consumers . 
 
The task of offering debt settlement services is an 
immense one. Among other things, it requires capital; 
highly skilled labor; scalable and efficient information 
technology systems; intricate knowledge of how 
creditors and collection agencies work; skill in building 
efficient business processes and in properly servicing 
clients; and a deep sense of compassion for those in 
debt. The key components of a debt -settlement 
company are an underwriting department that ensures 
quality in the cases being enrolled; a negotiations department that negotiates with creditors on a 
client’s behalf; a customer service division trained in handling inquires from clients who are 
stressed, anxious and scared; and an executive team committed to excellence.

“I would like to take the opportunity to thank your firm for their commitment, work ethic, communication and 
actually friendship in aiding me through some of the roughest parts of my fiscal life. All of your staff really 
surprised me at the dedication they used to settle the accounts I trusted you with. Being a widow and single 
father, I found myself over extended and muddled into some larger debt than I never though t would happen 
to me. It’s funny how quick I went from being ahead to being behind and worri ed about my financial future. 
Thanks to you and your team all of the accounts were settled quickly and professionally. Bust most of all was 
the amount your company saved me. On one account alone I saved over three thousand dollars. Though I 
still have a li ttle way to go to getting back on my feet, without ClearOne Advantage’s help I don’t even want 
to think about where my finances would be! Again thank you from my family for the fantastic job your 
company did. I advise anyone out there that may need help in the debt reduction area to really try ClearOne 
Advantage. You will not be disappointed!”

Consumer Debt Relief Initiative – 
 
CDRI Consumer Debt Relief Initiative (CDRI) was founded in late 2020 as a new association to represent 
the debt settlement industry. Our founder is a veteran industry expert dedicated to the proposition of 
improving the narrative around debt settlement. CD RI’s primary areas of concentration will be on proactive 
advocacy and coalition -building, as we believe they are key to reducing legislative threats and regulatory 
scrutiny. 
 
CDRI also believes the industry needs an association with a zero -tolerance policy for bad actors in the 
debt space . CDRI members must adhere to a strict Code of Ethics that raises the bar for ethical standards, 
fairness and transparency when providing debt settlement services to consumers. The CDRI seal is a badge of 
honor that ensures integrity – given only to debt s ettlement operators that continuously demonstrate a 
commitment to non -circumvention of federal and state regulations. Our board of directors i s comprised of 
recognized industry influencers and thought leaders. 
 
CDRI is committed to establishing itself as the authoritative voice of the debt settlement industry. To 
that end, CDRI advocates for its member debt settlement firms in the halls of Congress, in state capitals and 
within regulatory bodies throughout the Un ited States. The Consumer Debt Relief Initiative (CDRI) is dedicated 
to the protection and promotion of the debt settlement industry. 
 
We serve our members through educational development opportunities and advocacy before 
lawmakers, regulators, and the public. CDRI is committed to advancing the highest consumer protection 
standards to ensure that debt -distressed consumers have access to s afe and transparent solutions to achieve 
financial stability.

Revised 9.202 5 Credit Counseling/ Debt Management Plans 
 
• These agencies provide a repayment plan for 100% of the debt with reduced interest, that typically 
lasts 60 months. 
• The plans are often cheaper than minimum payments on credit cards, but more than a debt settlement 
payment. 
• The agency may be non -profit or for -profit. 
Advantages Disadvantages 
▪ Once a client is in the program, creditor 
harassment stops. 
▪ Typically, credit card companies agree to 
lower the interest rates and eliminate some 
fees. 
▪ Monthly payments can decline moderately. 
▪ A gradual positive impact as on -time 
payments are received and reported by 
creditors. When all debts are eliminated, 
there should be a generous impact on your 
credit score. 
▪ One consolidated payment ▪ Founded 50 years ago by the credit card 
industry itself, credit counseling companies 
are funded in part by the credit card 
companies through “Fair Share ” (kickbacks 
for collections from consumers). 
▪ Slightly negative early impact to credit - A 
remark will show on the credit report for 
each account that is being managed. This 
could seem to lenders like you can’t handle 
your debts. 
▪ Must pay back 100% including interest 
▪ Typically takes 5 years or more to complete 
▪ Must have sufficient income to meet 
program guidelines 
▪ Advanced delinquency is a disqualifier. 
▪ The graduation rate is extremely low. 
▪ Set-up fees and monthly fees 
▪ Cards are typically frozen or closed during 
program

Revised 9.202 5 Client Relationship s 
 
At ClearOne Advantage, every agent will speak with clients. Sales enrolls the 
client, the Customer Loyalty Group manages the client’s program, and 
Negotiators call clients for special drafts and authorizations. Each time we speak 
with the client, we are CO A. You become COA in the eyes of the client. When we 
speak with them, they will say, “I spoke with COA today.” We must always be 
thinking of how to build a better relationship with the client. 
 
Building a better relationship with the client includes: 
• Fully explaining what is going on with their program. 
• Being honest. 
• Following through on promises made to the client. 
• Returning client phone calls and emails in a timely fashion. 
• Showing respect when interacting with the client. 
Most program cancellations are due to agents missing these points. Sometimes 
we may forget to call a client back to follow up. Or we gloss over important points 
of the program because they sound negative, and we do not want to upset the 
client. Each of these undermines COA’s relationship with the client. It seems to 
the client as if they are not important or that COA is not being honest. The debt 
settlement industry has a bad reputation due to bad players that did not follow 
ethical practices. We now must overcome that by being credible, knowledgeable, 
and transparent.

Revised 9.202 5 The Special Purpose Account 
 
As part of the contract execution process, a special purpose account is opened 
in the client’s name which is used to accumulate funds while we work to reach 
settlements. This is an FDIC insured account housed at a bank. A client’s drafts 
will all be processed by Global Holdings , the third -party payment processor. A 
client’s monthly/semi -monthly/bi -weekly program drafts will be deducted 
automatically from their checking or savings account and deposited in this 
special purpose account by G lobal Holdings . 
ClearOne never touches, holds, receives, or controls clients’ money. Once a 
settlement has been agreed upon and the client has authorized that 
settlement, G lobal remits the payment to the creditor on the client’s behalf 
according to the terms of the settlement . Once the first settlement payment is 
made to a client’s creditor, ClearOne is entitled to collect fees for services 
rendered for that account . Those fees are paid to ClearOne from the Client’s 
Global account. 
 
Follow the Money 
Global Holdings is the third -party payment processing company who receives and 
distributes the clients’ funds during their program. It’s important to notify the 
client of this so they aren’t confused when they see Global GHLLC.com on their 
bank statement.

## FTC Regulations

## Key Takeaways
- Lead with consultation, not pressure.【23†source】
- Use the term **healthy** when comparing options to avoid definitive claims like "you cannot get a loan."【23†source】

## Compliance Notes

## Examples
**Example: Healthy framing**
"Right now you are not likely to qualify for a healthy consolidation loan that improves your finances because of X and Y. Let's review safer options."【23†source】
