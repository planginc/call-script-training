# Presenting Plan (Bad vs Good News)
- Use a calm, consultative tone. Educate on all options first, then outline why settlement is healthier for their profile.【23†source】

## Detailed Program Explanation
- Client drafts to settlement account. We negotiate one account at a time. We collect fees only after first settlement payment to creditor on that account.【23†source】

## How Credit Will Look
- Expect a score decline during delinquency. Reframe to goals and affordability. Many clients worried the most are in **580 to 650** range.【23†source】

## Creditor Calls
- Calls are part of the process while accounts age. Coach clients to block numbers or use robocall tools. Avoid client-creditor conversations to prevent mixed messaging.【23†source】

## Litigation
- Low risk but possible. Legal protection helps. If anything happens, client should contact customer service right away.【23†source】

## Tax Consequences
- Potential tax on forgiven debt. Prepare to discuss and refer to tax guidance. (PDF language to be inserted verbatim.)

## Key Takeaways
- Set expectations early to reduce cancel risk. Broken expectations and unaffordable payments are the top cancel drivers.【23†source】

## Compliance Notes
> Do not instruct clients to dodge creditors by changing contact info. We do not endorse that practice.【23†source】
