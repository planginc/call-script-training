# The Budget
- Ensure the monthly program payment is sustainable for the full term. For already-behind clients, budget risk is higher and must be checked closely.【23†source】

## Exceptions
- Start date beyond 30 days needs manager approval note. Use for fixed income or monthly pay cycles like teachers.【23†source】

## Verification
- Use underwriting for pre and final checks. Many files will auto approve once you ramp.【23†source】

## Getting Start Date
- Min 3 business days to first draft, avoid holiday Mondays and weekends. Target within 14 days for retention and speed to pay goals.【23†source】

## Drafting Options
- Prefer split or biweekly drafts tied to pay dates to reduce fails and improve client cash flow. Commission eligibility starts after first split clears about 45 percent of payment.【23†source】

## The Agreement
- After preapproval and ID/bank verification, send agreement for signature and submit for final approval.【23†source】

## Key Takeaways
- Split drafts align with real pay cycles and reduce stress.【23†source】

## Compliance Notes
> Do not set unrealistic start dates just to book a deal. Ensure funds timing and bank setup will clear on time.【23†source】
