Read aloud in a warm, reassuring, welcoming tone
Speaker 1: The first option I recommend to my clients is to **"pay the debt off on your own"**. Now in order to do so, we would have to double your monthly minimum payments to about **$1,500**, stop using the cards altogether, and still comfortably pay all of your other monthly expenses. Based on the budget we just completed, is this something you think you could manage monthly for the next 3-5 years comfortably?
Speaker 2: No, absolutely not. I can barely afford the $750 I'm paying now.
Speaker 1: I understand. Most of my clients are not in a position to double their minimum payments, so do you agree that **"paying the debt off on your own"** is not your best option?
Speaker 2: Yes, I definitely agree.
Speaker 1: The next option clients typically pursue is a **"Consolidation Loan"**. This is when you apply to borrow a loan to pay off the full debt amount and then pay the loan back in a 3-5 year term. Typically, you need to have a stellar credit rating and make 3-4 times the amount of the loan you’re looking to borrow. Based on the credit score we reviewed in your credit profile, and the red flags we discussed, I don't see where you’re going to qualify for the loan amount needed to pay off this debt in full. I’m also assuming you weren’t looking to add another monthly expense to your budget today, correct?
Speaker 2: No, I am definitely not looking for another loan payment, and like I said, I already tried to get one and was denied.
Speaker 1: I understand. Even if you did qualify for the loan, I never recommend trying to borrow your way out of debt. Right now, your debt is spread over minimum payments for the next 15-17 years. Guess what happens when you take that full debt amount and pack it into a 3-5 year period with additional interest on top?
Speaker 2: The payment goes way up.
Speaker 1: Exactly! And when you start to struggle with the higher loan payment, you go back to using your cards, and that’s how you double your debt amount. At that point, your only realistic option is **"Bankruptcy"**, and I’m assuming you want to avoid that, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Does this make sense on why a consolidation loan is not your best option?
Speaker 2: Yes, it makes perfect sense.
Speaker 1: The last two options are programs you can use to pay off your debt. The first program is a creditor-based program called **"Consumer Credit Counseling"**. This program reduces the amount of interest you pay on the accounts; however, they still require you to pay the full debt amount, which doesn’t provide monthly savings. It’s typically a five-year program, and because you have to pay the full amount in a shorter timeframe, it tends to increase your monthly payments. I normally only recommend this to clients who have less than $7,500.00 in debt because it’s a more successful option at that amount. Do you feel Consumer Credit Counseling would be a good option for you?
Speaker 2: No, if the payment goes up, I can’t do it.
Speaker 1: The last option is a hardship program that your state's legislation allows you to participate in, and it's called **"Debt Settlement"**. This is the only option out of the five available that lets you reduce your monthly costs because you’re avoiding future compounding interest on the debt, and the principal balances are negotiated to a reduction of 25-30% on average, including all creditors and fees. Due to that reduction on the principal balance, it also lowers your monthly payment in half on average, giving you monthly savings and getting you out of debt in a shorter period of time. Now, you will need to voluntarily stop the payments directly to the creditors, which will have a **negative impact on your credit score**. Does that make sense?
Speaker 2: Yes, it does.
Speaker 1: Based on the options I just went over with you, what one do you think would realistically help you pay this debt off?
Speaker 2: **Debt Settlement** seems like the only one that makes sense.
Speaker 1: I agree! Based on what you shared with me earlier in the call—your hardship, current financial situation of needing to reduce your monthly expenses, and consolidating everything into one payment—I think **"Debt Settlement"** is your best option as well. Let me explain how the process works in more detail...
