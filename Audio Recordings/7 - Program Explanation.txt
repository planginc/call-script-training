Read aloud in a warm, reassuring, welcoming tone
Speaker 1: So let me explain exactly how the debt settlement program works:
Speaker 1: **STEP 1:** Due to your situation that we discussed—the job loss and the lower income—you will voluntarily stop making payments to the creditors and will stop using the credit cards. You cannot get out of debt if you are still using the cards, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, you may be thinking, "this will hurt my credit score," and you are correct, it will have a negative impact. You will then start making a new single monthly payment into an **FDIC insured dedicated settlement account** owned and controlled in your name. Your monthly program payments will accumulate in this account and ultimately be used to pay your creditors and program fees as negotiations occur.
Speaker 2: Okay, that makes sense for where the money goes.
Speaker 1: **STEP 2:** We will begin communicating with your creditors, and during the course of negotiations, we will explain your situation and the reason for your missed payments. **STEP 3:** We will then start negotiating with your creditors on your behalf. Most clients see their first settlement within the first 60 to 120 days. After that, as you continue to make payments according to your plan and funds become available, we will continue to negotiate more settlements with your remaining creditors.
Speaker 2: That quickly? I thought this would take forever.
Speaker 1: **STEP 4:** Once your creditor agrees to a settlement, we will contact you immediately to get your approval to start processing payments. We make no money until we’ve negotiated a settlement that you’ve approved, and at least one payment has been made as a result of the new settlement. Our flat fee is **25%** of your total estimated enrolled debt amount, and this is built into your monthly program payment with us.
Speaker 2: That's fair. You only get paid when I approve a result.
Speaker 1: **STEP 5:** When you have successfully paid as scheduled and your creditor has been paid all the newly structured payments, you should start to see improvement on your credit profile as those accounts are updated by the credit bureaus. But we urge you to use debt wisely to maintain your financial freedom once you’ve worked so hard for it. What questions do you have for me about the program?
Speaker 2: No, that all sounds very clear and straightforward.
Speaker 1: CLOSING: If I can get you approved for a 36-month program at the estimated **$400** program payment, would this be an option you would feel comfortable with to help you finally pay off your debt?
Speaker 2: Yes, that payment sounds completely manageable.
Speaker 1: Great! I would now like to discuss a service that I highly recommend to all my clients called **Legal Protection Services**. This is a legal club that costs **$29.95** a month and has already been factored into the program payment I just quoted. This service provides added protection for your program, specifically in the event of a lawsuit. Legal Protection Services grant you access to a law firm who will represent you throughout the case and is prepared to appear in court if needed. Most of our clients choose to take advantage of this service in order to help with the success of the program.
Speaker 2: Okay, that sounds like a smart precaution, especially since I'm stopping payments.
Speaker 1: TRANSITION: I’m going to submit your file to our underwriting department so they can give us pre-approval. Also, we will quickly complete a budget analysis to get an estimate of your monthly expenses. Our goal is to make absolutely sure you can afford your customized plan. Let's get started!
