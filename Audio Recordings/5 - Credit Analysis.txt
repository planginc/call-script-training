Speaker 1: Michael, let's look at the two main factors impacting your credit report and, most importantly, keeping you in debt. The first is **Credit Utilization**. Since all four of your cards are maxed out or very close to their limits, your utilization is very high. This is a major red flag for lenders. Does that sound like what you’re experiencing?
Speaker 2: Yes, that’s exactly right. They're all full.
Speaker 1: The second major factor is **Payment History**. While you've mostly been current, skipping that one Discover payment has already started to impact your history. Now that we've reviewed your credit report, Michael, I can see why you're looking for options. When your balances are this high, and you can only afford the minimum payment of $750, most of that money goes straight to interest and fees. This means: **First**, you’ll be trapped in debt for a very long time. **Second**, your credit score will continue to be impacted because your balances aren't coming down. **Third**, you'll have a difficult time putting any money away for personal savings. You are caught in that debt cycle. Does that all make sense?
Speaker 2: It does, and it's frustrating because I'm trying my best.
