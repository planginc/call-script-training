Speaker 1: Thank you, I will be confirming your debts with you to ensure we’re not missing anything. Then we will review your credit report to fully understand your credit profile. Lastly, we will discuss the best available options for you to get rid of your debt. Do you have a pen and paper around to write this information down?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: Great. Based on the credit analysis, the first account I see is a Bank of America card with a balance of approximately $8,000. Next is a Chase Freedom card with a balance of about $7,500. Then there is your Discover card, where you missed that one payment, with a balance of $5,500. And finally, a Capital One card at $7,000.
Speaker 2: That sounds about right.
Speaker 1: Perfect. That gives us a total of **four accounts** and an estimated total debt of **$28,000**. And, as you mentioned, you are currently paying out about **$750** just in required minimum monthly payments. Does that all look accurate?
Speaker 2: Yes, it does.
Speaker 1: Can you think of any accounts that are missing from this list? Often, payday loans, business debts, medical bills, and accounts like PayPal will not report to the credit bureaus.
Speaker 2: No, I think those four cards are the only things I'm worried about right now.
Speaker 1: Ok, wonderful. Does anyone else in the household have any unsecured debt?
Speaker 2: No, it's just my debt.
Speaker 1: Now, let’s go over a no-cost credit analysis that will give us better insight on how we can help you today! There are multiple factors that I see impacting clients on their credit reports. The main one is high credit utilization, which decreases your credit score and increases your interest rates. This makes it almost impossible for you to pay off the debts in a reasonable amount of time, even though you’re making your payments on time every month. Does this sound similar to your situation with your accounts?
Speaker 2: yes, it does.
Speaker 1: ok, let’s take a closer look at your report and see how we can assist!
