Speaker 2: Well, honestly, I'm just looking for help. I have about $28,000 in debt across four credit cards, and I can barely make the minimum payments anymore. I feel like I'm drowning.
Speaker 1: I completely understand, Michael. That sounds incredibly stressful. So, just to make sure I heard you correctly, you have about $28,000 in credit card debt between 4 cards and you're struggling to keep up with the required minimum payments. Is that the situation?
