Read aloud in a warm, welcoming tone
Speaker 1: Thank you for sharing that with me, Michael. I can completely understand how stressful this must be. What changed financially that made you inquire about consolidating your debts today?
Speaker 2: I got laid off from my job about six months ago. I found new work quickly, but it pays about $800 less per month than my old job. I'm currently only making about $3,400.00 a month.
Speaker 1: I see. So the financial struggle has been going on for about six months now, ever since the layoff. Is that correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah, pretty much. Six months.
Speaker 1: And just to clarify the impact on your income, you went from making around $4,200 a month down to $3,400 a month, which is about $800 less. Is that an accurate recap?
Speaker 2: That is exactly right.
Speaker 1: Thank you for sharing that with me, Michael. That's a significant drop, and it perfectly explains why you reached out. You're in the right place.
